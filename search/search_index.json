Four library kinds are currently supported: Local , Plex , Jellyfin and Emby . ErsatzTV supports a subset of media kinds when synchronizing from media servers, i.e. Plex , Jellyfin and Emby only support Movies and Shows . Local Libraries support all media kinds: Movies , Shows , Music Videos , Other Videos and Songs . Local Libraries Local libraries provide a way to schedule media directly from folders; no media server is necessary. Metadata With local libraries, ErsatzTV will read metadata from NFO files , falling back to a minimal amount of metadata if NFO files are not found. Add Libraries ErsatzTV provides four local libraries by default, one for each supported media kind: Movies , Shows , Music Videos , Other Videos and Songs . Additional libraries can be added under Media Sources > Local . Add Media Items To add media items to a local library under Media Sources > Local , click the edit button for the library: In the Path field, enter the path where your media files of the appropriate kind are stored: Finally, click Add Path . When you have added all of your media paths, click Save Changes and ErsatzTV will scan and import your media items. Plex Libraries Plex libraries provide a way to synchronize your media (metadata) from Plex to ErsatzTV. This synchronization process is one-way: changes made within Plex are synchronized to ErsatzTV. ErsatzTV will never make any modifications to your Plex configuration or media. Metadata With Plex libraries, Plex provides all metadata. Add Media Items Sign In To add media items from Plex, under Media Sources > Plex click the Sign in to Plex button and sign in with your Plex account. Synchronize Libraries After signing in, select which libraries you would like to synchronize from Plex to ErsatzTV by clicking the Edit Libraries button for the desired Plex server. In the libraries listing, click the Synchronize switch for all libraries you would like to synchronize from Plex to ErsatzTV, and click the Save Changes button to start the synchronization process. Path Replacements Media items are not streamed from Plex media sources. Instead, ErsatzTV will attempt to play media items from disk using the same path that Plex uses to play the media item. There are two ways to make this work: Ensure ErsatzTV has access to exactly the same shares and mounts as Plex Configure path replacements to tell ErsatzTV where it should look on its file system for a given Plex folder Option 1 is recommended as it will \"just work\" without any further configuration. To configure path replacements for a Plex media source, click the Edit Path Replacements button in the Click Add Path Replacement to add a new path replacement, and enter the Plex Path along with the equivalent Local Path for ErsatzTV. Click Save Changes after you have created all needed path replacements. Jellyfin Libraries Jellyfin libraries provide a way to synchronize your media (metadata) from Jellyfin to ErsatzTV. This synchronization process is one-way: changes made within Jellyfin are synchronized to ErsatzTV. ErsatzTV will never make any modifications to your Jellyfin configuration or media. Metadata With Jellyfin libraries, Jellyfin provides all metadata. Add Media Items Connect to Server Connecting to a Jellyfin server requires two settings: the server address and an api key. Server Address The server address is the address that you type in your web browser to access your Jellyfin server. API Key To create a Jellyfin API Key, from the Admin / Dashboard in Jellyfin, select Advanced / API Keys and click the + button near the top. Give the API Key a name like ErsatzTV and click Ok . The API key is then displayed. Configuration Finally, in ErsatzTV, under Media Sources > Jellyfin click the Connect Jellyfin button, enter the Address and Api Key and click Save Changes to connect to your Jellyfin server.

Channel Number Channel numbers can be whole numbers or can contain one decimal, like 500 or 500.5 . Streaming Mode Four streaming modes are currently supported. Ideally one of the two primary streaming modes should be used; secondary streaming modes are only needed in some edge cases. Primary Streaming Modes The two primary streaming modes are HLS Segmenter (HTTP Live Streaming Segmenter) and MPEG-TS (Transport Stream). HLS Segmenter transcodes content, supports watermarks and offers the best performance at program boundaries MPEG-TS is a light wrapper over the HLS Segmenter streaming mode and provides support for clients that require an HDHomeRun tuner Secondary Streaming Modes The two secondary streaming modes are HLS Direct (HTTP Live Streaming Direct) and MPEG-TS (Legacy) (Legacy Transport Stream). HLS Direct does not transcode content and can perform better on low power systems, but does not support watermarks and some clients will have issues at program boundaries MPEG-TS (Legacy) transcodes content and supports watermarks, though some clients will have issues at program boundaries. This mode will be removed with a future release. FFmpeg Profile FFmpeg Profiles are collections of transcoding settings that are applied to all content on a channel. The default FFmpeg Profile is probably \"good enough\" for initial testing. Logo Channel logos can be added using the Upload Logo button and the logos will display in most client program guides. Create Schedule Schedules are used to control the playback order of media items on a channel. Create a Schedule by navigating to the Schedules page, clicking Add Schedule and giving your schedule a name, and selecting the appropriate settings: Keep Multi-Part Episodes Together : This only applies to shuffled schedule items, and will try to intelligently group multi-part episodes (i.e. s05e02 - whatever part 1 and s05e03 - whatever part 2 ) so they are always scheduled together and always play in the correct order. Treat Collections As Shows : This only applies when Keep Multi-Part Episodes Together is enabled, and will try to group multi-part episodes across shows within the collection (i.e. crossover episodes like Show 1 - s03e04 - Whatever Part 1 and Show 2 - s01e07 - Whatever Part 2 ). Schedule Items Schedules contain an ordered list of items (collections), and will play back one or more items from each collection before advancing to the next schedule item. Edit the new schedule's items by clicking the Edit Schedule Items button for the schedule: Add a new item to the schedule by clicking Add Schedule Item and configure as desired. Start Type Items with a Dynamic start type will start immediately after the preceding schedule item, while a Fixed start type requires a start time. Collection Type Schedule items can contain the following collection types: Collection : Select a collection that you have created manually. Television Show : Select an entire television show. Television Season : Select a specific season of a television show. Artist : Select all music videos for a specific artist. Multi Collection : Select all collections within a multi-collection. Smart Collection : Select all items that match a saved search query. Collection Based on the selected collection type, select the desired collection.

A collection can contain a single media type, eg. movies or any combination of media types. The items to be added can be found by browsing your libraries or by using ErsatzTV's powerful Search feature. An empty collection can be created under Lists > Collections > Add Collection . To create a collection, find the media items you would like to include and select them by clicking the selection button in the top left of the poster: Then, add to a collection by clicking the Add To Collection button at the top of the page. In the Add To Collection dialog, either select an existing collection for the items, or enter a new collection name to create a collection and add all of the selected items in a single step. Smart Collections Smart Collections are created by saving searches or saving imported Trakt Lists. From Searches To create a smart collection, type a search query in the search box and press enter. If the result shown meets your expectations, save as a Smart Collection by clicking the Save As button. If it doesn't meet your expectations, refine the search query until it does and then save. From Imported Trakt Lists To import a Trakt List, navigate to the Lists > Trakt Lists page and click the Add Trakt List button. Trakt lists can be imported by url or by user/list . To re-download a Trakt List, simply add it again. There is no need to delete. Unmatched item details are written to the log. Trakt Lists can only be scheduled after being saved as a Smart Collection.
